# U.S. Automaker Supply Chain Shift: A 5-Year Impact Analysis

This repository contains a Shiny app built in R to explore the hypothetical impacts of U.S. automakers (Ford, GM, Stellantis, Tesla) shifting to exclusively U.S.-owned suppliers for key components (semiconductors, plastics, steel, batteries, electronics) under current tariffs and a 60% reduction in Chinese dependency over five years (2026–2031). The app visualizes supplier locations and provides interactive, year-specific impact data.

## Summary
This project simulates a drastic pivot by U.S. automakers to domestic suppliers, driven by tariffs (e.g., 25% on steel, 100% on Chinese EVs) and a strategic 60% cut in reliance on Chinese components. The Shiny app accomplishes:
- **Interactive Visualization:** Maps U.S. suppliers (e.g., Intel, Nucor) with clickable markers showing impacts like cost increases, job creation, and production disruptions.
- **Yearly Breakdown:** Analyzes effects from 2026–2031, reflecting short-term chaos (e.g., $5,000–$15,000 vehicle price hikes) and long-term stabilization (e.g., 200,000+ jobs).
- **Component Focus:** Covers semiconductors, plastics, steel, batteries, and electronics, key to automotive supply chains.
Developed with R, Shiny, Leaflet, and dplyr, this tool offers a data-driven lens on a critical economic shift, blending real-world trends with hypothetical forecasting.

## Background
As of April 2025, U.S. tariffs and geopolitical tensions are pushing automakers to rethink supply chains. China dominates components like EV batteries (cheaper by one-third) and semiconductors, but tariffs and security concerns are driving a domestic focus. This case study hypothesizes a 60% reduction in Chinese dependency, forcing reliance on U.S.-owned plants for plastics, semiconductors, electronics, and steel/aluminum. The analysis spans five years, capturing initial disruptions and eventual recovery.

## Potential Impacts
Based on the analysis:
- **Years 1–2 (2026–2027):** Production dips 20–30%, vehicle prices rise $5,000–$15,000, 50,000+ jobs created, but competitiveness lags (e.g., -15% market share for battery suppliers).
- **Years 3–4 (2028–2029):** Costs ease (e.g., 20–40% drop), jobs peak at 200,000+, production stabilizes, but global share remains shaky.
- **Year 5+ (2030–2031):** Prices settle 5–10% above 2025 levels, 100,000–300,000 total jobs, competitiveness recovers (+5% market share), EV adoption normalizes.
Key drivers: tariffs (25% steel, 100% Chinese EVs), domestic capacity limits, and China’s cost advantage.

## Why This Matters
This shift could reshape the U.S. auto industry and economy:
- **Economic Security:** Reducing China dependency by 60% mitigates risks like rare earth bans, strengthening national resilience.
- **Jobs vs. Costs:** 200,000+ jobs could revitalize manufacturing states, but higher car prices ($55,000–$65,000) might burden consumers and slow EV adoption, clashing with climate goals.
- **Global Standing:** Short-term losses to Chinese firms (e.g., BYD’s $12,000 EVs) risk U.S. market share, but long-term innovation could reclaim leadership.
It’s a high-stakes trade-off—protectionism vs. competitiveness—relevant to policymakers, industry leaders, and consumers.

## Conclusion
This Shiny app offers a window into a pivotal “what-if” for U.S. automakers: a forced pivot to domestic supply chains under tariffs and reduced Chinese reliance. It blends real-world data (supplier locations, tariff effects) with hypothetical impacts, making it a valuable tool for exploring economic strategy. While speculative, it highlights the tension between security, cost, and innovation—questions that will define the industry’s future. Contributions to refine data or impacts are welcome!
